# challenge-6-serverside-apis

## Description

This was my bootcamp's 6th homework assignment. In this project we were told to make a weather dashboard with a saved search history, details about a city's current weather conditions and a five day forecast showing the future weather conditions. Since this was an even numbered assignment we had to build the website with no starting code. This project was the first time I have ever used serverside APIs. The API used was from a website called openweathermap.org.

## Usage

This website can be used to look at current weather conditions for a city you live in, or in a city across the world. This is useful for traveling becuase you can be informed of weather conditions in a city you might plan to travel to.
